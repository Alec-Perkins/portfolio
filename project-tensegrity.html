					<h3 class="well-title-text">Tensioning Cables</h3>
					<p class="well-body-text">Unfortunately, I made a mistake when purchasing the tensioning cables for this project. After
						cinching down the cables and tightening the tension to balance the chair, I realized that the best approach would be to
						use slightly elastic cables. Each cable would be stretched a bit, so they
						would hold the seat and base together tightly for better stability. </p>

				<div class="well d-flex flex-column h-100">
					<h3 class="well-title-text">Tools</h3>
					<p class="well-body-text">I did not have the tools needed to slice a board lengthwise to make interlocking lap joints. I tried several approaches before finally making small cuts, chiseling chips off the board, more cuts and more chiseling, and finally sanding it smooth to give it strong glue joints. Having the right tools for the job would have made it <i>so</i> much easier!

				<div class="well d-flex flex-column h-100">
					<h3 class="well-title-text">Installing triangle supports</h3>
					<p class="well-body-text">The triangle supports had to be linked together before being attached to the base or underside of the seat. If not, I wouldn't be able to attach the base and seat together. Unfortunately, this made accurately screwing and gluing the triangle support to the base extremely difficult because the whole seat had to be already attached to the opposing triangle support.

					<h3 class="well-title-text">Tensile Stress Testing</h3>
					<p class="well-body-text">In order to test the strength of my joints and construction and to confirm my theory that the stainless steel turnbuckle was the weakest point of the build, I conducted strength tests. I first did some research into how tensile stress is measured and used the equation <strong>stress = force/cross_sectional_area</strong>.
					</p>
					<p class="well-body-text">The turnbuckle manufacturer claimed it was rated to hold a 175-pound load. I used the 2mm radius of the turnbuckle screws to determine the cross-sectional area. That cross-sectional area supporting a maximum of 175 pounds would mean the metal had a maximum tensile stress of about 60 megapascals (1 pascal = 1 newton per sq. meter.) But stainless steel is known to have a maximum tensile stress of at least 300 MPa, or at least five times as much. I assumed the difference was partly explained by a conservative load rating (a margin of safety), but even more by an expected failure mode where excess load would strip the screw threads before breaking the whole screw.</p>
					<p class="well-body-text">I tested it to failure (see table above). The results seem to confirm my hypotheses. It held more than 175 pounds (conservative rating) but not five times that much. The screw diameter was not the limiting factor. The threads stripped.
