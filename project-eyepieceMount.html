					<h3 class="well-title-text">What I struggled with</h3>
					<p class="well-body-text"><strong>Tensioning Cables</strong></p>
					<p class="well-body-text">&#x2022 Unfortunately, I made a mistake when purchasing the tensioning cables for this project. After 
						attempting to sinch down the cables and tighten the tension to balance the chair, I realized that the best construction should
						use very slightly elastic cables so I could set each cable in a state of  slightly stretched elongation and they would be constantly 
						forcing the seat and base together for far better stability.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class="well-body-text"><strong>Tools</strong></p>
					<p class="well-body-text">&#x2022 In order to join the base and seat boardering cuts of wood together with lap joints, horizontal
						cuts needed to be made, halving each end edge of each piece along its side edge. I first attempted to use miter saw to cut down
						along the long edge of the wood, but this failed becuase the cut would have been a curved cut instead of a straight cut.
						Instead, I flipped the wood on its wider side and made many consecutive slices half way into the depth of the wood and 
						chisled the remaining pieces off for each edge. I then sanded the remaining surface for the strongest glue joining.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class="well-body-text"><strong>Installing triangle supports</strong></p>
					<p class="well-body-text">&#x2022 The triangle supports had to be linked together before being attached to the base or underside of
						the seat or else I wouldn't be able to attach the base and seat together. Unfortunately, this made accurately screwing and gluing
						the triangle support to the base extremely difficult since the whole seat had to be already attached to the opposing triangle support.

					<h3 class="well-title-text">Tensile Stress Testing</h3>
					<p class="well-body-text">In order to test the strength of my joints, construction, and confirm my theory that the stainless steel turnbuckle
						was the weakest point of the build, I conducted strength tests. I first did some research about how tensile stress is measured and 
					used the equation (stess = force/cross sectional area).</p>
					<p class="well-body-text">With this equation I predicted the turnbuckle would fail somewhere over 61.95 megapascals applied from the
						load on the seat using a radius of 2 millimeters of the screws in the turnbuckle to find my cross sectional area. This is because
						the turnbuckle I purchased was rated for 175 lb load. When I did further research, I found that the maximum tensile stress of stainless
						steel is about 310 MPa. I concluded that my predicted failure value was much lower because when the turnbuckle fails, it would not be due to 
						the turnbuckle screws snapping at their cross sectional area, but instead due to the threading shearing off, making the maximum tensile stress
						much lower.</p>
					<p class="well-body-text">The data table above from my tests that followed these calculations more or less confirmed my theories, though the 
						turnbuckle was much stronger than I expected!
